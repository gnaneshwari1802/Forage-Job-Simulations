Task 1: Web scraping to gain company insights

Here is your task
Scrape data from the web
The first thing to do will be to scrape review data from the web. For this, you should use a website called Skytrax.

The team leader wants you to focus on reviews specifically about the airline itself. You should collect as much data as you can in order to improve the output of your analysis. To get started with the data collection, you can use the “Jupyter Notebook” in the Resources section below to run some Python code that will help to collect some data. 

Analyse data
Once you have your dataset, you need to prepare it. The data will be very messy and contain purely text. You will need to perform data cleaning in order to prepare the data for analysis. When the data is clean, you should perform your own analysis to uncover some insights. As a starting point, you could look at topic modelling, sentiment analysis or wordclouds to provide some insight into the content of the reviews. It is recommended to complete this task using Python, however, you can use any tool that you wish. You can use some of the documentation websites provided in the Resources section below to analyse the data.

Please ensure that you have created a folder called "data" and mapped your file path.

Present insights
Your manager would like you to summarise your findings within a single PowerPoint slide, so that they can present the results at the next board meeting. You should create visualisations and metrics to include within this slide, as well as clear and concise explanations in order to quickly provide the key points from your analysis. Use the “PowerPoint Template” provided to complete the slide.

Once you’ve completed your PowerPoint, please submit your document below.
